# Upload Cypress videos and screenshots directly to Slack

This Github action enables you to take the screenshots and videos generated by Cypress after a test run and upload them directly to a Slack channel of your choice. All files are contained within a single message thread to minimize noise.

## Inputs

### `token`

**Required** Slack app token. See [Internal app tokens](https://slack.com/intl/en-ru/help/articles/215770388-Create-and-regenerate-API-tokens#internal-app-tokens)

- Create an app
- Add `file:write` and `chat.postMessage` permissions
- Install the app into your workspace
- Invite the bot to whatever channels you want to send the videos and screenshots to `/invite <botname>`
- Grab the bot token from `OAuth & Permissions` page

### `channels`

**Required** Slack channels to upload to

### `workdir`

**Optional** The folder where Cypress stores screenshots and videos on the build machine.

Default: `cypress`

(this relative path resolves to `/home/runner/work/<REPO_NAME>/<REPO_NAME>/cypress`)

If your project uses Cypress from the project root folder, the default value will work for you.
But if your project uses Cypress in a subfolder (like most monorepos), you'll need to provide the relative path to that folder
(i.e. `e2e/cypress`).
(Don't include a trailing slash on your path!)

### `messageText`

**Optional** Custom Slack message text.

Default: `A Cypress test just finished. I've placed the screenshots and videos in this thread. Good pie!`

## Examples

### Upload results after every push

```yml
on: [push]

  test-and-upload-results:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

### Only upload when open PRs fail
